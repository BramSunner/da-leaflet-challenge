# About the Project
This project takes a geoJSON of earthquakes within the past thirty days and plots it on a leaflet map.  
The markers for the earthquakes are color-coded according to the depth of the earthquake (darker is deeper).  
Also, the markers are sized according to their magnitude (the larger, the higher the magnitude).
