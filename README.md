# About the Project
This project takes a geoJSON of earthquakes within the past thirty days and plots it on a leaflet map.  
Markers for the earthquakes are formatted such that:
1. various colors denotate the depth of the earthquake (darker is deeper).
2. varying sizes depict the magnitude of the earthquake (larger is higher magnitude).
